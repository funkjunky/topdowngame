TODO Isogame
—

 - create a new game called “topdowngame”
	- create it
	- compile it for web
	- compile it for ios IPAD

 - using my knowledge from Jane’s game, get a map working
	- create a blanket map that’s just a bucket of grass alrge enough to cover ipad.
	- import it into the game and render it
	- render Jane’s sprite

 - figure out clicking
	- find a way to click on the map and move the character
 - figure out tapping for mobile
	- first read if there is a cocos way to grab both in the same way
	- if not, then make my own.
