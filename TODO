 *- figure out clicking
	*- find a way to click on the map and move the character
 *- figure out tapping for mobile
	*- first read if there is a cocos way to grab both in the same way
	*- if not, then make my own.

 *- figure out selecting a character
	*- yes, but do I even want to use getCurrentTarget()? Or just use globals?

 *- Make a GameMap class
	*- takes the tiled map
	*- has a function move(char, location), moves character to location
		*- onClick, call move
		*- move tweens character to location
	*- add getCoords that returns the grid(x,y)
		*- return x,y, width, and height of the tile we are querying for
	*- add mouseMove event that uses getcoords to move a green square that highlights the tile we are hovering over.
	*- make function findPath(start, end) that returns an array of sequential locations to tween to to get to destination.
	*- move should call findPath to get the sequential actions to be taken
	*- fix location highlighting… it seems to move the character to the wrong location?
	*- fix speed.

 *- further testing Astar
	*- extend map with more objects
	*- it’s inconsistent and sometimes goes through objects. 

 - make an enemy character
	- shows up top left corner
	- use a rat sprite

 - be able to click on a character
	- capture clicking on the enemy sprite (console.log)
	- don’t process the map click. Cancel bubbling or something somehow.
	- set engaged for the character to true.

 - make a cocos2D npm package if one doesn’t already exist! We’ll use that instead of cocos new whatever.
 - package more things!! Things are getting to messy.

 - battle
	- create a class for character
		- has range(), windup(), reload(), damage(), health(), type [enemy, player]
	- If a character is “engaged” with another character and that character is in “range” attack it
		- give player character the “player” type and the enemy “monster” type
		- ensure the player attacks the monster whenn in range.
		- ensure the monster gets “engaged” when attacked and starts attacking.

 - add battle text!
	- show numbers above the character that took damage. Red for player, black for other.
	- It should “jump” at a random angle between 20 degrees  left or right from up. With a force, then fall naturally fast and fade quickly after the up swing.

 - respawn the enemy when it dies

 - add in the RO sprite for swordsman for attacking
	- figure out how to use spritesheets properly [use mounted peco peco if it isn’t too challenging, just cause it’s fun]
	- get the walking animation working
	- play the attacking animation over the duration of windup
	- play the hurt animation when the enemy attacks

 - Add some stats to the game that are used to calculate range(), windup(), etc.
	~max stat would be 99.
	- i have to think about this but something like RO
	- strength: dmg multiplier [damage <= str * wpnpower]
	- agility: [windup <= 1 - (agility / 100)]
	- dexterity: [reload <= (100 / dexterity + 100) - (dexterity / 250)]
	- health: [health <= 100 + [vitality * 10] + [2 ^ round(vitality / 8)]

 - create a new scene for upgrading stats
	- add a button to press on the screen that brings up this new scene
	- add a god variable that allows the stats to be changed at will
	- add UI for the 4 stats. They should be big enough that 6 of them would take up the whole screen. Each having an up and down arrow.
	- I should show the range(), windup(), etc. on this screen as well and it should update as the stats get changed.
	- also show an exp stat and a level stat.

 - add exp and levels
	- when a monster is killed the player gets exp
	- when exp > (level * 10 + 2 ^ round(level / 5)) ++level [give 4 + (level/10) points] and reset exp
	- every 10 points into a stat increases the cost by 1.
